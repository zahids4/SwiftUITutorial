    /**
     @Published is one of the most useful property wrappers in SwiftUI, allowing us to create observable objects that automatically announce when changes occur. SwiftUI will automatically monitor for such changes, and re-invoke the body property of any views that rely on the data. In practical terms, that means whenever an object with a property marked @Published is changed, all views using that object will be reloaded to reflect those changes.
     
     Apple provides us with three ways to use state in our apps: @State is for simple local properties, @ObservedObject is for complex properties or properties that are shared between views, and @EnvironmentObject is for properties that are indirectly shared potentially by many views
